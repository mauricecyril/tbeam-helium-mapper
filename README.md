<!-- ## TTGO T-Beam Tracker for The Things Network and/or The Helium Network  -->
# TTGO T-Beam Mapper for the Helium LoRaWAN Network.
by [Max-Plastix](https://github.com/Max-Plastix/tbeam-helium-mapper/)

### TL;DR
Read through the comments in the three source files listed below.  Edit to taste, compile, and Upload to your TTGO T-Beam device.  Drive around and map the Helium network!

This is a modified version that removes checks for Batteries. Allows batteryless setups for safety in extreme conditions. Mapper device will have to rely on external power (ie. vehicle power etc). 

## Purpose
The goal of this version is to have a **TTGO T-Beam** Mapper that's ideally suited to walking or driving, taking cues from the USB Power source and movement for activity level.  

This device uploads GPS coordinates from the TTGO T-Beam to the Helium network, be used for tracking and determining signal coverage of LoRaWAN gateways and hotspots. 
With this software and a T-Beam device, one can contribute to the [Helium Network](https://www.helium.com) Mapper or Cargo projects. 
Details for the Mapper project can be found [here](https://mappers.helium.com/) and details for Cargo can be found [here](https://cargo.helium.com/)

The Mapper is intended to be highly active while the vehicle is in motion, and quieter when the vehicle is stationary.    By default, it is not miserly with Data Credits.  If you want to conserve Data Credits or battery power, tune the default configuration to send packets less frequently.

### But do I get PAID for Mapping?!

No, you do not.  I put this here because it seems to be the #1 FAQ.  You do not earn HNT or Data Credits by mapping.  Mapping costs you very little -- One Penny (USD $0.01) for every thousand mapping packets.  It helps the Helium network by providing a coverage map, and it helps you by providing clarity on your own local Helium environment.

## Supported Hardware
I tested this software on (several) LilyGo TTGO T-Beam v1.1 devices, all on **US915**.  These are commonly avaialable as "Meshtastic" devices from AliExpress, Amazon, Banggood, eBay, etc, usually as a kit with an unsoldered OLED screen and SMA antenna.

If you have an older v0.7 board or different region, adjust the configuration to match.  If you have a unique variant (Neo 8M?) and find something not working, open an Issue and provide what information you can.

# Mandatory Configuration
Before Buliding and Uploading, you will probably want to inspect or change some items in these three files:
  - `platformio.ini`
  - `main/configuration.h`
  - `main/credentials.cpp`

The comments and text below will guide you on what values to look out for.  By default, this build is for the **US915** region.  Change `platformio.ini` for a different locale.
You might have to adjust the COM Port in `platformio.ini` for Uploading and Monitoring if PlatformIO doesn't auto-detect your port correctly.

You should choose your own AppKey value in `credentials.cpp`. Either take the random one suggested by the Console Device entry, or make up one of your own.  Read the notes in `credentials.cpp` for details.  By default, the DevEUI is generated automatically to be unique to each unit, but you may want to hardcode it in `credentials.cpp` instead.

Read through the comments in `configuration.h` to see if the default Mapper behavior suits your needs, especially in the area of default time/distance between Uplink packets.

## How it Works
When your car is started, and USB Power appears, the Mapper will power on, acquire GPS, and continue mapping.
It re-uses the last network Join state for faster connection and fewer packets.

The Mapper is always looking to see if it's been a long time, or you moved some distance from the last report.  Whichever one happens first causes a transmission to be sent, plotting a point on the Helium map.

When moving, the Mapper will send out a packet every time GPS indicates it has moved `MIN_DIST` meters.  This is the primary knob to turn for more/fewer packets.  A Helium hex cell is about 340meters across, so the default 68-meter packet distance will send quite a few redundant packets for each mapped cell.  DC is incredibly cheap, but adjust the distance if you want to send fewer packets.

This is the normal operation of the Mapper in motion.. every `MIN_DIST` meters, one ping reporting position, while the battery charges from USB.  If the speed of motion is fast, it may even result in back-to-back packet sends (at greater distance) limited by the bandwidth of your chosen Spreading Factor (Data Rate) and country restrictions.  (In the United States US915, at SF10, this is about two seconds maximum speed.  In Thailand, it can be 37 seconds or more.)

When the Mapper comes to a stop, staying within `MIN_DIST` meters, it sends a hearbeat ping every `STATIONARY_TX_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 60).  This serves to keep it visible on the map and report battery voltage.  Too often?  Dial up the `STATIONARY_TX_INTERVAL` to a longer interval.

After being stationary a long time (parked) with a decreasing battery voltage, we change to a slower pace of updates.  This happens after `REST_WAIT` seconds (default: 30 minutes).  In the Rest state, the Mapper transmits every `REST_TX_INTERVAL` seconds (default: 5 minutes).

Eventually, the ~100mA power drain of the mapper (with OLED screen & GPS) runs the battery down below `BATTERY_LOW_VOLTAGE` volts, and the Mapper will save state and completely power off.
It will power on and resume only when USB power appears.

# Detailed Operation

## Buttons

The TTGO T-Beam has three buttons on the underside: 
1. Power: Nearest the USB connector is the Power button.
- Menu: **short press** while on will enter the Menu display.  Use the Power button to step through options, and the **Middle** button to select a menu entry.
- Off: **long press** on this button will turn the unit completely off (5 seconds).
- On: A 1-second press will turn it back on.
2. Middle Button
- A **short press** will select the active Menu entry.
- A **long press** will force an Uplink packet to be sent right now.
3. Reset
- The button furthest from USB is the Reset button.  It instantly reboots the device, and is not handled by software at all.

## USB Serial (UART) messages
The device outputs debugging information on the USB Serial connection at 115200bps.
### ESP32 Bootloader
On powerup or reset, the very first messages will be from the Bootloader built into the ESP system.  This is before any Mapper software runs and should look something like this:
```
ets Jul 29 2019 12:21:46

rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
configsip: 0, SPIWP:0xee
clk_drv:0x00,q_drv:0x00,d_drv:0x00,cs0_drv:0x00,hd_drv:0x00,wp_drv:0x00
mode:DIO, clock div:2
load:0x3fff0018,len:4
load:0x3fff001c,len:1044
load:0x40078000,len:10124
load:0x40080400,len:5828
entry 0x400806a8
```

If you see garbage text, line noise, or nothing at all, double check that both the monitoring port and bitrate (115200,8,N,1) are configured correctly in your terminal interface.

### Mapper System Startup
After the bootloader, the first message from this Mapper software will be:
```
BOOT #1!  cause:0 ext1:00000000
```
indicating that the system experienced a normal boot (instead of a timer wakeup or other sleep event).

Next are some important debugging messages printed at startup, indicating whether the OLED screen, AXP Power Management IC, and GPS were found and initialized.  If these are not found or connected quickly, then there could be a hardware failure, soldering error, or other board-level issue preventing the software from working correctly.

You should see `AXP192 PMU` on the T-Beam, and `SSD1306 OLED display` if a display is installed.  If you see neither of these, the i2c port likely has problems.
If you expected an OLED display, and none was found, then it may be misconnected.

After this are serveral data messages about voltages and settings, largely uninteresting, until you get to..

### Settings and Credentials
On startup, the USB Serial port will print the DevEUI, AppID, and AppKey values, suitable for cut & paste entry into the Helium Console for your Device.
For some, this is the easiest way to configure a new device.  Upload the software, monitor the first boot, then cut & paste the values from the messages into the Console "New Device" setup.

#### Saved Preferences
The Mapper will retain certain settings across power cycles.
* Minimum distance
* Stationary Tx Interval (min time)
* Rest Wait (time until slower reporting)
* Rest Tx Interval (slower reporting interval)
* LoRaWAN DR/SF

### Network Join

The Mapper will flash the Blue LED at 4Hz and attempt to Join the Helium network by sending a Join Request packet using the configured locale.  This is the most common point of failure as it requires both a transmitted Join_Request and a received Join_Accept message.  If there is no hotspot nearby, the network Join will not complete and the unit will continue retrying until coverage is available.  There are several reasons a Join might fail:

1. Out of Range: The nearest Helium hotspot can't hear the device, or the device can't hear the response.
2. Wrong RF configuration or Localization:  The frequency band and protocol must match the local Helium Network, as configured in `platformio.ini`.
3. The Device keys are not correctly registered in the Helium Console.  Check all three.
4. The Device was recently added to Console and is still "Pending" or waiting for XOR Filter update to propegate through the blockchain or network.  This can take 20 minutes or more.
5. Helium network outage.  Any failure in the helium network that prevents Join will hang here, as was seen often in November 2021.
6. RF or hardware issues.  Disconnected antenna, mismatched antenna frequency, etc.

### Or, Re-Join
Once the Mapper joins the Helium network, it stores these Network Key credentials for future use.  Ideally, the Mapper does not have to send a Join request at the next startup, but fetches them from the nonvolatile "Preferences" memory.  To successfully continue with these same credentials, the Mapper needs to continue the Frame Count from prior transmissions, or the Helium network will reject Uplink packets as "Late" (for re-using old Frame Count values).

When you see `(re-used join)` on the screen and serial log, this means no Join Request/Accept packets were sent, and the unit will attempt to use the same credentials.

There are some instances where this is problematic or not correct:
* Frame count lost without saving
* Device keys changed on Console from last use
* Very long time since last Uplink
* Helium Network resets that invalidate Join keys.

At any time, you can select `Flush Prefs` in the system menu to discard these keys, reset the device, and Join fresh.

### GPS Connected
You should also see a message reporting `GPS connected`.   The first time you run this software on hardware that came with Mestastic or other builds, it will automatically try all common baud rates to find the Neo GPS module.  Eventually it will connect, then configure the GPS for the needed NMEA Messages at 115,200 bps, then save the configuration to flash so that subsequent boot is faster.  In any case, you should always see `GPS connected` at startup.

This means the Mapper is receving NMEA messages at the expected bitrate, but it may not yet have a 3D position fix from the GPS.

## LED Indicators

The T-Beam has three LEDs.  Unfortunately, two of them are underneath the typical OLED screen placement, so might be hard to see or concealed by a case.

1. GPS Red LED, lower right on the board.  This flashes once each second when the GPS has a position fix.  It is controlled by the Neo 6M hardware and outside of software reach, so if this LED is not flashing, there is no useable GPS position.
2. AXP Blue LED.  This LED is controlled entirely by the AXP PMIC, and configured by software commands as on, off, or flashing.  In this build, it indicates:
* ON: A packet is being sent on LoRaWAN
* Flashing at 4 Hz: The first packet has not yet been successfully sent after startup
* Off: Normal operation, nothing going on.
3. ESP Red LED.  The Red LED is not very bright or easy to see.  Mapper lights this LED when a Confirmation request has been sent, and then turns the LED off when the confirmation Ack was received.  This is a handy visual at-a-glance indicator that the unit is expecting to receive an Ack from the network.  If you see this LED remain lit for an extended time, it means the network might be unreachable.

## OLED Screen Display
The T-Beam usually comes as a kit with a 0.96" SSD1306 OLED screen that you must solder to power & i2c pins.

The OLED screen is always on when operating, as it uses only 10mA.

### Status Bar
Operating Status is shown in the top two rows, with a running 4-line message log in the region below the line.

The top status line alternates between two displays every few seconds:
- `#ABC` is the last three hex digits of your DevEUI, so you can match it to the correct device in Console.  Handy if you have several Mappers that look the same.
- `4.10v` is the battery voltage
- `48mA` is the charge (or discharge) current to the battery.  The TTGO charges the battery cell at around 300mA from USB, when possible.
- Satellite Count is displayed on the right at all times.
- The GPS Time of Day (UTC) alternates on the display line every 2 seconds.
- A `*** NO GPS ***` message will show when no GPS Fix is available.

The second line shows the current operating parameters.. Time Interval (seconds), Distance Interval (meters), and Spreading Factor / Bandwidth used for Uplink.

### Message Log
The lower part of the OLED screen shows a scrolling display of four messages.  
Most often, it shows the last Uplink packet sent:
* Frame Count is the first number, which you can match to the Uplink packet shown in Helium Console.
* The Trigger that caused this Uplink message: `T` for Time, `D` for Distance, or `>` for menu requested "Just Send".
* Time since last Uplink (seconds)
* Distance since last Uplink (meters)

Next is a cryptic set of characters showing how the Uplink proceeded, and how many packets were retried.
* `+` is shown for any radio transmission.  Each `+` is one Uplink.
* `?` is shown if a Confirmation (Ack) was requested as part of this Uplink
* `!` is shown when an Ack is received.

So, an Uplink might look like:
`1850 T 120s 1m ?++!`
for Frame Count 1850, a time-triggered packet after 2 minutes and only 1 meter away from the last one.  Confirmation was requested.  The first Uplink didn't get an Ack, so a second Uplink was sent.  Then an Ack was received.

How often Acks are requested is configurable, defaulting to one-every-ten.

# Uplink Payload
The Payload Port and byte content have been selected to match the format used by CubeCell mappers as well:
Lat, Long, Altitude, Speed, Battery, and Sats.  This common decoder function can now be used for both TTGO and CubeCell mappers:

```
// From https://github.com/hkicko/CubeCell-GPS-Helium-Mapper
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  var decoded = {};
  
  var latitude = ((bytes[0]<<16)>>>0) + ((bytes[1]<<8)>>>0) + bytes[2];
  latitude = (latitude / 16777215.0 * 180) - 90;
  
  var longitude = ((bytes[3]<<16)>>>0) + ((bytes[4]<<8)>>>0) + bytes[5];
  longitude = (longitude / 16777215.0 * 360) - 180;
  
  switch (port)
  {
    case 2:
      decoded.latitude = latitude;
      decoded.longitude = longitude; 
      
      var altValue = ((bytes[6]<<8)>>>0) + bytes[7];
      var sign = bytes[6] & (1 << 7);
      if(sign) decoded.altitude = 0xFFFF0000 | altValue;
      else decoded.altitude = altValue;
      
      decoded.speed = parseFloat((((bytes[8]))/1.609).toFixed(2));
      decoded.battery = parseFloat((bytes[9]/100 + 2).toFixed(2));
      decoded.sats = bytes[10];
      decoded.accuracy = 2.5; // Bogus Accuracy required by Cargo/Mapper integration
      break;
  }
     
  return decoded;  
}
```

Note that HDOP is not sent in this data.

# Downlink
This builds adds the option to reconfigure the Mapper remotely via Helium Downlink (network to device).  You can change the maximum Time Interval, Distance, and Battery Cut-off voltage remotely.

#### Format your Downlink Payload.

You can use the `console-decoders/downlink_encoder.py` Python script to convert your intent into a Base64 Payload.
```
% python downlink_encoder.py --help
usage: downlink_encoder.py [-h] [--distance DISTANCE] [--time TIME] [--cutoffvolts CUTOFFVOLTS]

Encode a downlink payload for a Helium mapper.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --distance DISTANCE, -d DISTANCE
                        Map distance interval (meters)
  --time TIME, -t TIME  Minimum time interval (seconds)
  --cutoffvolts CUTOFFVOLTS, -c CUTOFFVOLTS
                        Low Voltage Power Off (volts)
 ```

For example, you might want to change the Mapper to 75 meter distance, and 600 second maximum time:
 ```
% python downlink_encoder.py -d 75 -t 600
00 4B 02 58 00
AEsCWAA=
```
That last output `AEsCWAA=` is the Base64-encoded payload, ready to use.

#### Queue the Downlink packet for transmission
Paste that payload into the Helium Console under the Downlink panel for that device.  Select a specific device, then the "Cloud Down-arrow" icon on the right ("Send a manual downlink to this device") to open the Downlink panel.

Leave FPort set to the default (1), and type as default (Base64).
Queue it for transmission using the Cloud down-arrow button, and the packet should appear in the Download Queue.

When the mapper next reports (uplink), it will receive this directive and show the updates on-screen.
To rush things along, you can cause an immediate Uplink (& Downlink) by pressing the middle button on the TTGO.

#### Allowed values
Setting any value to zero will leave the present value unchanged by the downlink.
Maximum Distance interval can be 1 to 65,534 meters.  Time interval can be 1 to 65,534 seconds.  A special time interval of `-1` indicates that you want to remove any override and revert to the time interval in the software build configuration.

Battery voltage cutoff can range from 2.0 to 4.5 volts.  If you set a cutoff higher than the present battery voltage, the Mapper will immediately power down.  When it reboots (on USB power present), the default battery cutoff will be restored from the software build.

None of the Downlink values persist across power-off & on; the device always reverts to compiled-in values on startup.

# History and Credit

This build is a modification of work by many experts, with input from the [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) `#mappers` community.  Thanks to @Kicko, Fizzy, and @tmiklas especially, along with the work done on similar builds for the Heltec CubeCell mappers and Helium Integrations.  The helpful text below is quoted from prior forks:

The Fork history here in Github shows the lineage and prior work, including  https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/tree/master/TTGO-TBeam-Tracker

This code was originally developed for use on The Things Network (TTN) it has been editied/repurposed for use with the Helium Network.

This version is based on a forked repo from github user [kizniche] https://github.com/kizniche/ttgo-tbeam-ttn-tracker. Which in turn is based on the code from [xoseperez/ttgo-beam-tracker](https://github.com/xoseperez/ttgo-beam-tracker), with excerpts from [dermatthias/Lora-TTNMapper-T-Beam](https://github.com/dermatthias/Lora-TTNMapper-T-Beam) to fix an issue with incorrect GPS data being transmitted to the network. Support was also added for the 915 MHz frequency (North and South America). [lewisxhe/TTGO-T-Beam](https://github.com/lewisxhe/TTGO-T-Beam) was referenced for enabling use on the newer T-Beam board (Rev1).

This is a LoRaWAN node based on the [TTGO T-Beam](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T-Beam) development platform using the SSD1306 I2C OLED display.
It uses a RFM95 by HopeRF and the MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC stack. This sample code is configured to connect to The LoRaWan network using the US 915 MHz frequency by default, but can be changed to EU 868 MHz.

NOTE: There are now 2 versions of the TTGO T-BEAM, the first version (Rev0) and a newer version (Rev1). The GPS module on Rev1 is connected to different pins than Rev0. This code has been successfully tested on REV0, and is in the process of being tested on REV1. See the end of this README for photos of each board.

### Setup

1. Install VisualStudio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. Add the PlattformIO extension within VS Code (https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

3. Check Device Manager if a serialdevice appear on conntecting the T-Beam. If nothing appears a driver for the USB to serial Adpater need to be installed.(https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

3. Check and edit platformio.ini to use the right bandplan for your region.

4. Within the Helium Console, add a Mapper or Cargo integration.
- step by step details for setting up a Mapper integration can be found [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/coverage-mapping/mappers-quickstart/#mappers-quickstart).
- detail for setting up a Cargo integration can be found [here](https://docs.helium.com/use-the-network/console/integrations/cargo).

The specific details for adding a Mapper or Cargo integration use a different edge node device than the one detailed here. When prompted to add a function decoder, be sure to use the following decoder. Note: This decoder can also be found within this project in the console-decoders directory.

5. Open this project file ```main/main.ino``` with the Arduino IDE Verify/Compile the project. If the compile is successful upload the application to your TTGO T-Beam.

6. Disconnect and turn on the device and once a GPS lock is acquired, the device should start sending data to the Helium network and Helium Mapper or Helium Cargo depending upon which you configured in step 6.

### Using the Mapping Data

Now that your device is hopefully connecting to the Helium network refer to the following for more details about interpreting the mapping data.
